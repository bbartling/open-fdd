## üî• What is open-fdd?
**open-fdd** is an **open-source Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) tool** designed for analysts and engineers using local toolsets like Jupyter notebooks. It is not necessarily an IoT tool for **Grafana**, which an MSI (Master Systems Integrator) might use, though it could be adapted for that purpose. Instead, it is tailored for **individual engineers analyzing historical HVAC system data** using the **Pandas computing library**. While it could potentially be integrated with a database, doing so may require additional effort. It leverages **ASHRAE** and **NIST**-inspired fault equations. Built on Python and **Pandas**, this library enables efficient detection of operational issues in HVAC systems with:

This version improves clarity and flow while keeping it professional and readable. üöÄ Let me know if you want any more refinements!

‚úÖ **Pre-built fault equations** for detecting HVAC anomalies
‚úÖ **Seamless Pandas integration** for time-series analysis
‚úÖ **Extensible architecture** for custom fault conditions
‚úÖ **Open-source & community-driven** development

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Installation
Install `open-fdd` from PyPI with:
```bash
pip install open-fdd
```

### Quick Example
```python
import pandas as pd
from open_fdd.air_handling_unit.fault_condition_one import FaultConditionOne

# Sample data
data = {
    "timestamp": pd.date_range(start="2023-01-01", periods=10, freq="15T"),
    "supply_air_temp": [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63],
    "return_air_temp": [70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70],
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Run fault detection
fault_checker = FaultConditionOne(df)
df_faults = fault_checker.process()
print(df_faults)
```

## üìå Project Goals
`open-fdd` aims to provide a full-featured **Fault Detection & Diagnostics (FDD) platform** with:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- [x] Air handling unit (AHU) fault conditions & reports (aligned with ASHRAE/NIST)
- [x] PyPI distribution for easy installation

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Jupyter notebook tutorials showcasing AHU FDD examples + BRICK metadata integration
- [ ] Expansion to **central plant** fault conditions (chillers, boilers, pumps)
- [ ] Jupyter notebook tutorials showcasing AHU FDD examples + BRICK metadata integration

### ‚è≥ Upcoming
- [ ] **Energy Efficiency** fault detection & reporting
- [ ] **Metering** fault analytics & data modeling
- [ ] **SQL Integration** for storing results & visualizing in Grafana
- [ ] Dedicated documentation site (`github.io` or ReadTheDocs)
