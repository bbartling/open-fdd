Open-FDD is an open-source Automated Fault Detection and Diagnostics (AFDD) platform specifically designed to run inside the building, behind the firewall, under the owner’s control. It transforms operational system data into actionable cost-saving insights while providing a secure integration layer that any cloud platform can leverage without vendor lock-in. Independent U.S. Department of Energy research reports median energy savings of roughly 8–9% from FDD programs, representing meaningful annual cost reductions depending on facility size and energy spend.

## Quick Start — Open-FDD AFDD Platform

Open-FDD uses Docker and Docker Compose to orchestrate and manage all platform services within a unified containerized environment. It has been tested on Ubuntu Server and Linux Mint running on x86-based systems.

### 🚀 Platform Deployment (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbartling/open-fdd.git
cd open-fdd
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

This will start the full AFDD edge stack locally.

## 🔐 Reverse Proxy & Endpoint Protection (Caddy)

In production deployments, Open-FDD is intended to sit behind a Caddy reverse proxy for:

* TLS termination (HTTPS)
* Basic authentication or JWT protection
* Endpoint access control
* Secure remote access

Example Production Architecture on the Building’s Operational Technology (OT) LAN

The bundled Caddyfile routes **API paths** (e.g. `/docs`, `/api/*`, `/sites*`, `/analytics/*`, `/health`) to the Open-FDD API and all other paths to **Grafana at root** (`/`). Path-prefix routing (e.g. `/api` and `/grafana`) can be configured via a custom Caddyfile and Grafana subpath; see [Security & Caddy](docs/security.md).

**Option 1 — Caddy on the Open-FDD host, vendor edge device on a separate host**

Building Network (OT LAN)

```
   │
   ├── Open-FDD Host (Docker)
   │      ├── Caddy Reverse Proxy (HTTPS + Authentication)
   │      │      ├── API paths (/docs, /api/*, /sites, /analytics, …) → Open-FDD API
   │      │      └── / → Grafana
   │      ├── TimescaleDB (internal)
   │      └── BACnet Server (internal)
   │
   └── Vendor Edge Gateway (X / Y / Z)
          ├── Pulls data from Open-FDD via Caddy URL (LAN)
          └── Secure Export to Cloud Platform (Vendor-managed)
```

Caddy provides secure access to internal services without exposing raw ports externally. The Vendor Edge Gateway represents any third-party or cloud-connected service on the OT network. Secure export of data to external cloud platforms is the responsibility of the vendor or integration partner—not Open-FDD.

Open-FDD operates strictly as a behind-the-firewall AFDD engine and API layer. It does not initiate outbound cloud connections or manage external data transmission.


**Option 2 — Vendor runs Open-FDD inside their own Docker stack**

Building Network (OT LAN)

```
   │
   ├── Open-FDD Host (Docker)
   │      ├── Caddy Reverse Proxy (HTTPS + Authentication)
   │      │      ├── API paths → Open-FDD API
   │      │      └── / → Grafana
   │      ├── TimescaleDB (internal)
   │      ├── BACnet Server (internal)
   │      └── Vendor Edge Gateway (X / Y / Z)
   │             ├── Pulls data from Open-FDD via Caddy (internal)
   │             └── Secure Export to Cloud Platform (Vendor-managed)

## 🏢 What This Stack Represents

This deployment runs a complete behind-the-firewall AFDD platform that:

* Ingests building telemetry (e.g., BACnet, weather)
* Stores structured time-series data
* Executes automated fault detection logic
* Exposes insights via API
* Enables vendor-neutral cloud integration

The building maintains full control of operational data while enabling secure interoperability with external analytics platforms.

## Platform config example

Copy to `platform.yaml` and edit.
Environment variables (`OFDD_*`) override these values.

```yaml

rule_interval_hours: 3    # run every 3 hours
lookback_days: 3          # historical window loaded per run

# Rules: put your project rules here (hot reload)
rules_dir: "analyst/rules"

# BACnet driver (edge scraping via diy-bacnet-server)
bacnet_enabled: true
bacnet_scrape_interval_min: 5
bacnet_config_csv: "config/bacnet_device.csv"

# Open-Meteo weather driver
open_meteo_enabled: true
open_meteo_interval_hours: 24
open_meteo_latitude: 41.88
open_meteo_longitude: -87.63
open_meteo_timezone: America/Chicago
open_meteo_days_back: 3
open_meteo_site_id: default
```

## Standalone (Python + Pandas)


Open-FDD v2 will be published to PyPI as a standalone package for CSV-based analysis or for companies that want to embed DataFrame-driven FDD into existing analytics workflows. The AFDD engine is built on Pandas, Python’s high-performance data analysis library. This enables rule execution directly on DataFrames without requiring the full Docker-based platform deployment.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
from open_fdd.engine.runner import RuleRunner, load_rule

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "timestamp": ["2023-01-01 00:00", "2023-01-01 00:15", "2023-01-01 00:30"],
    "OAT (°F)": [45, 46, 47],
    "SAT (°F)": [55, 56, 90],
})

runner = RuleRunner(rules_path="open_fdd/rules")
result = runner.run(df, timestamp_col="timestamp", rolling_window=3, skip_missing_columns=True)
# result has fault flag columns (e.g. bad_sensor_flag)
```
