# my_rules — Your fault rules for your deployment

This folder holds **your** YAML fault rules. Copy it, rename it, and customize it for your own BAS data.

The tutorial scripts (`check_faults_ahu7_flatline.py`, `check_faults_ahu7_bounds.py`) load rules from here. Add your own rules or modify the existing ones to match your equipment and column names.
