# my_rules — Your fault rules for your deployment

This folder holds **your** YAML fault rules. Copy it to your desktop (or anywhere), rename it if you like, and customize it for your own BAS data. You can run the tutorial from your own folder — it doesn't need to be inside the repo. The repo clone is only for installing open-fdd from source; future versions will be on PyPI.

The tutorial scripts (`check_faults_ahu7_flatline.py`, `check_faults_ahu7_bounds.py`) load rules from here. Add your own rules or modify the existing ones to match your equipment and column names.
