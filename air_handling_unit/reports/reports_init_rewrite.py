Also visually verify with the AHU off via lock-out-tag-out that the mixing dampers operates effectively. To do this have one person the BAS sending operator override commands to drive the damper back and forth. The other person should put on eyes on the operation of the actuator motor driving the OA dampers 100 percent open and then closed and visually verify the dampers rotate effectively per BAS command where to also visually verify the dampers have a good seal when in the closed position. Also consider looking into BAS programming that may need tuning or parameter adjustments for the staging between OS state changes between AHU modes of operation',

If this AHU has a DX cooling coil there could be a problem with the refrigerant charge. It could be worth viewing mechanical blue prints for this AHU design schedule to see what cold water temperature this coil was designed for and compare it to actual cold water supply temperatures. IE., an AHU cooling coil sized to have a 44°F water flowing through it may have significant performance reduction with 48°F water flowing through it and under design day type high load conditions this AHU may not meet setpoint or properly dehumidify the air for the building which could potentially also lead to IAQ or mold issues if %RH levels in the zones are kept within tollerance. Also check excessive outside air faults in fault condition 6 that the AHU isnt taking in too much outdoor air which could also cause coil performance issues if the load on the coil is higher than what it was intended for',
