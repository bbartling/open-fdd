# FDD and assignments

## What the product actually does

Open-FDD separates **data modeling** (BRICK equipment, points, `feeds` relationships) from **rule assignment** (which FDD rules apply to which points, equipment, or BRICK classes). Both are editable in **Model & assignments** and via commissioning JSON import.

### BRICK modeling (integrator + AI-assisted)

| Concern | Where it lives | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Equipment tree | `ModelService` + TTL sync | AHU, VAV, sensors; `equipment_type` and `brick_type` on points |
| `brick:feeds` | `model_feeds.py`, `ttl_service.py` | AHU→VAV→zone relationships; used by zone analytics and root-cause hints |
| Point registry | BACnet inventory → model points | `fdd_input` roles (`oa-t`, `stat_zn-t`, …), `series_id` / historian column |
| Commissioning import | `POST /api/model/commissioning-import` | Bulk JSON: sites, equipment, points, optional `fdd_rules` |

**AI Agent** (`agent_tools.py`) can read `slim_brick_graph`, `scope_bundle`, patch rule bindings, and upsert points — but it does **not** auto-generate a full site model without operator review. Expected workflow:

1. BACnet discover/poll populates point registry.
2. Integrator or agent tags `brick_type`, `fdd_input`, and `feeds` on equipment.
3. `POST /api/model/sync-ttl` writes `workspace/data/data_model.ttl`.
4. Model health (`model_health.py`) flags orphan points and missing `fdd_input`.

### Rule assignment (three binding kinds)

Saved rules in `rules_store.json` carry `bindings`:

```json
{
  "point_ids": ["5007-analog-input-1173"],
  "equipment_ids": ["bench-1"],
  "brick_types": ["Outside_Air_Temperature_Sensor"]
}
```

| Binding kind | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| `point_ids` | Rule runs for that historian point / series |
| `equipment_ids` | Rule runs for all points on equipment (mass bind) |
| `brick_types` | Rule runs for any point with that BRICK class on site |

Assign via:

- **Model & assignments** UI — equipment/point chips, rule pin menu on trend plot
- **Rule Lab** — bindings panel
- **Commissioning import** — `fdd_rules[].bindings` and per-point `fdd_rule_ids`
- **AI Agent** — `patch_rule_binding` tool

Runtime evaluation: `fdd_runner.py` (batch FDD) and `plot_readings.evaluate_fault_plots()` (trend overlays). Plot scope filters rules to those bound to **selected telemetry** (point, equipment, or BRICK class); unbound rules still evaluate site-wide.

**Brick bindings (3.0.20+):** when a rule binds `brick_types` (or `equipment_ids` / `point_ids`), the batch runner resolves **every** matching historian column via `historian_columns_for_rule`, runs the Arrow rule per column with `value_column` set, and OR-combines fault masks. One rule config therefore applies consistently to all zone temps, discharge temps, etc.

### CLASS vs device

- **BRICK class** (`brick_type` on points, or `brick_types` on rule bindings) — template-style assignment (“all `Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor`”).
- **Device / equipment** (`equipment_id`, BACnet device instance) — instance assignment (“this VAV-12”).
- **Point** (`point_ids`) — single-sensor assignment.

`applies_to` on legacy rules is deprecated; use `bindings` in 3.0+.

## Commissioning JSON shape

Export: `GET /api/model/commissioning-export`. Import accepts `import_ready_json` wrappers (see `commissioningImport.ts`).

### Rule names vs ids (Rule Lab alignment)

Rule Lab shows **human names** (`Bench OA-T flatline 1h`). Saved rules use stable **ids** (`bench-oa-t-flatline-1h` from setup scripts, or a UUID for uploaded custom rules). Commissioning export includes both so you never have to cross-reference sections by hand:

| Field | Direction | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `points[].fdd_rule_ids` | import + export | Assignment surface — array of rule ids |
| `points[].fdd_rules_linked` | **export only** | `[{id, name}]` — Rule Lab names beside each point |
| `fdd_rules[].id` | import + export | Stable rule key (matches Rule Lab / `rules_store.json`) |
| `fdd_rules[].name` | import + export | Same label as Rule Lab dropdown |
| `fdd_rules[].source_file` | export | Basename of deployed `.py` when present (e.g. `bench_oa-t_flatline_1h.py`) |

On import, `fdd_rules_linked` is stripped (like `fdd_rule_ids` — not stored in `model.json`). Use the **Point → FDD rule pins** table on Model & assignments to read names without parsing JSON.

Minimum fields integrators/AI should produce:

- `sites`, `equipment[]` with `id`, `equipment_type`, optional `feeds[]`
- `points[]` with `site_id`, `equipment_id`, `brick_type`, `fdd_input`, BACnet IDs, optional `fdd_rule_ids`
- `fdd_rules[]` with `id`, `name`, `bindings`, `enabled` (optional `source_file` on export)

After import, verify in **Trend plot** with `?fdd=1` — fault lanes appear on the right-hand 0/1 axis for bound rules.
