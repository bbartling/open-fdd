# Fault rules for HVAC

FDD fault rule types, YAML format, and expression cookbook for HVAC and building systems. Rules are **100% Brick-model driven**: inputs reference Brick classes only; column mapping comes from the Brick TTL and [Brick external timeseries references](https://docs.brickschema.org/metadata/external-representations.html#timeseries) ([timeseries storage](https://docs.brickschema.org/metadata/timeseries-storage.html)), which Open-FDD embraces at the heart of FDD.
